# Reddit-Sentiment

Web App that takes in a live stream from Reddit and analyzes keywords for sentiment using the sentiment package from npm. The data is then graphed using D3. React framework is being used.

Hosted on Heroku: Check out the working link on Heroku. (The app will take a 10-20 seconds to wake up because of how Heroku works).
You also need to give a few seconds for the reddit api to wake up as well. Comments will stop being streamed after 100 seconds since I don't want to throttle reddit's servers.
